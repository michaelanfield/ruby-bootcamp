# What does the ‘and’ keyword do? Is there anything special about it?

* It has a lower precedence than && or || but the same precedence as 'or'.
* The role is to provide flow control.
** You can use 'and' to chain operations together until nil or false is returned.
** You can do that because it does not evaluate any more than it has to.
